  | Join of string
      (** [Join s] represents the request to the server to join the game
          with the given code, [s]. *)
  | Joined of bool
      (** [Joined success] represents the confirmation response from the
          server of the request to join the game. If [success] is

  | Sendboard of Battleship.board
      (** [Sendboard b] sends the given board, [b] to the server.*)

          sent only if the game does not end as a result of the move.
          [pos] represents the position of the move, and [res]
          represents the result of the move, either a [Battleship.Hit]
          or a [Battleship.Miss]*)
  | Gameend of bool
      (** [Gameend win] is sent if the previous move resulted in the end
          of the game. [win] is [true] if the player has won, and
          [false] if the player has lost.*)
  | Error
      (** [Error] is a message from the server that means that something
          went wrong.*)
