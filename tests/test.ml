(** Test Plan

    Our tests mainly focused on extensively testing the State module. We
    omitted testing the Battleship, Person, and SelectLocation modules:
    The reason for mainly testing the State module is that with a game
    such as Battleship that is played with discrete turns, an instance
    of State.t describes everything that is going on in the game at one
    specific instant. The State module includes every step that
    progresses the game from one state to another, and every function in
    these other 3 modules that is useful to the functionality of the
    game is used by and encapsulated by the State moduleâ€™s functions.
    Additionally, a majority of the essential functions in these other 3
    modules return a type unit, which makes it extremely difficult to
    directly test those functions.

    We believe that our test suite demonstrates the correctness of our
    system because we included 50 unit tests covering

    - correct initialization of a player (2)
    - correct initialization of a state (3)
    - place_ship method inputs that result in a successful placement (5)
    - attack method inputs that result in a miss (10)
    - attack method inputs that result in a hit (17)
    - correctly identifying whether a game is finished (2)
    - place_ship method inputs that result in an exception to simulate a
      player making a mistake, including, placing an Unknown ship,
      placing a ship in an invalid location, and placing a ship in a
      location that would produce a ship collision (8)
    - attack method inputs that result in an exception to simulate a
      player making a mistake by shooting at an invalid location (2)

    We believe that with this collection of tests thoroughly checks for
    the correctness of all situation groups where a Battleship game
    changes state. This test suite demonstrates the correctness of our
    system because it covers all groups of actions that could influence
    a change from an old state to a new state, and therefore
    demonstrates the correctness of our Battleship game functionality.

    Testing was developed with black box testing by using the
    specification of the State module to construct tests and expected
    outputs, including tests of corner cases. Then, we included glass
    box testing after running make bisect to cover any possibilities of
    our implementation.

    We also omitted testing the networking component of our system. This
    is because we do not believe there is a way to use OUnit to test the
    correctness of the server we construct. The networking part of our
    system was manually tested by creating multiple multiplayer games
    and playing through them.

    In short, the State module, and by extension, the Battleship,
    Person, and SelectLocation modules, were tested by OUnit, while
    networking and ensuring user inputs were correctly read in from the
    terminal window were tested manually. *)
